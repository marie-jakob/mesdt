\description{
A subset of the data (20 participants) reported in Jakob, Shechter, Calanchini,
& Klauer (in prep.) investigating attributions to gender discrimination with
a signal detection theory approach.
Participants had to judge 256 fictional pay raise decisions as biased
or unbiased. The cases involved male and female employees (\code{emp_gender}), who
were either granted or denied a pay raise. A quarter of all cases was biased,
that is, the actual committee decision (\code{committee}) did not match the
objectively fair decision (\code{objective}). Across all biased and unbiased cases,
male and female employees were denied and granted a pay raise in equal
proportions; thus, there was no overall gender bias in the committee
decisions. Still, we found that participants' response bias was aligned with
cultural stereotypes about gender bias in pay raise decisions, that is, they
were more liberal to judge a decision as biased if a female employee was
denied or a male employee was granted a pay raise.
