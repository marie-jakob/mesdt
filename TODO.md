# TODOs


+ support for "||" notation -> check
+ support for mix of correlated and uncorrelated random effects
+ type 2 LRTs -> check
+ parallelization
+ pretty output
+ documentation
+ 
+ reduced random-effects structure
  + strategy 1: "keep it maximal"
  + strategy 2: Matuschek et al. 

+ optional other backends:
  + Julia MixedModels
  + glmmTMB  -> should work quite easily (apart from scope issues)

+ emmeans-like estimates + SEs

+ Plots
